The chart below shows the count of registered users based on their profession/occupation.

As the data shows, most of the users are coming from IT, which makes sense, considering the nature of the course. Second biggest category is "student" which is also to be expected. 

What is odd that very few of the people who have enrolled for the course are coming from a journalistic background, altough the course is very much focused on how to work and interpret data and visuals from a journalistic perspective.

Finally, there is also a big percentage of the users that are not employed. For them, the course probably provides an opportunity to upskill and find a job.

The next chart shows the count of enrolled users by the years they spend in education. Apparently, people with higher education are more interested in this course.
